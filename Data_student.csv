","I enjoyed the class and the content that I learned from it. There are a few areas that I would like to touch on. First, thank you for being
available at all times. I feel as though your communication with us was always open, and you always replied to any concerns we may have
had. However, the way in which you replied could be taken a bit harshly. As I understand we are graduate students and you have provided
us with the information to complete our assignments, when a student feels that they cannot reach out to you for fear of being belittled or
talked down to, I think there is a problem. Yes, you provided us with resources, but sometimes questions arise, and a simple yes or no
answer would suffice. Instead, there were times where you would try to make it full circle, make the student provide evidence for their
question, and pretty much make a student feel dumb or less than. One more concern I have is with the comp checks. Providing 20 min for
20 questions is inequitable and not inclusive. It takes me more than a minute to read and process a question before I can even think about
an answer that is provided. I have a processing delay, and I already have test anxiety. Therefore I believe it would be helpful and more
inclusive to provide more time. Within this program, we are taught to teach <Faculty Name>. We are taught (even in your own assignments) to think
about how we can be inclusive for all students and learners. So please, lead by example and set a standard that you're asking us to do in
our own assignments. You shoutouts each week to students who have gone ""above and beyond"" is great, I think they deserve to be
recognized, but doing shout outs for ""a thoughtful response"" is sending the message that no one else is thoughtful. You made it very clear
at the beginning of the semester that we were to call your Prof. P, Professor <Faculty Name>, or Dr. <Faculty Name>. You did this because your identity is
your last name, and you're proud of that. I love how honest you were, and you targeted that right away. A suggestion I have, however, is
that you give us the opportunity to let you know what we would like for you to refer to us by. Right off the bat, you called us Ms. or Mr. with
our last names. Some of us don't like our last names as our identity and prefer our firsts. Some of us might also not recognize as Ms. or
Mr., at CSUF, I have always taken a lot of pride in the fact that my professors always ask for our pronouns when we introduce ourselves. I
wish you would have done the same. I know what you're thinking, ""you're grad students, use your voice, speak up"". Yes, I agree, we
should and we could. However, it doesn't hurt for you, as our professor, to ask and show us that you actually care. I know that sounded like
a lot of negatives, and I apologize, but overall I really enjoyed your class. I appreciate you offering multiple zoom sessions where you
would provide answers to any questions we might have had for assignments. I appreciate you giving us another opportunity to hand in an
assignment that seemed to be missing the mark. As I stated earlier, I have taken a lot from your class, and I believe I have grown
immensely as a graduate student after this course. But please, remember, even though we're grad students, we're still human. We have
emotions and feelings. Some of us are more sensitive than others, and I ask that you keep that in mind. Thank you.

easier for the note taking process and studying as well. In the beginning of the semester she mentioned that she would post the notes on
Titanium that way we could print them out to take notes in class, but again she failed to do so. When students would ask their peers
questions involving the lecture, she would get mad at us for asking others questions rather than her, yet when we would ask her questions
she would get mad and vaguely answer our questions. Also, we would not be given enough time to turn things in. We would meet on

","I appreciated that modules were regularly open two weeks in advance. Discussion prompts often required more information than could
reasonably be provided in the expected length and prompts did not always lend themselves to commenting on others' responses. Actions
that I suspect the instructor thought were supporting independent learning were condescending (e.g., saying and posting that we're
masters students). Perhaps this is beyond the scope of one instructor, but this course was peculiarly planned. The beginning seemed to
introduce some learning principles, then it shifted to a practical focus on web-based design, then further narrowed to publishing responsive
objects, before trying to jump back to learning theory and design decisions at a much more advanced level than the opening weeks.
Perhaps replacing a couple of the many discussion prompts with short assignments to bridge the gap and make the course learning
outcomes clearer. Using the publishing software was well paced for a novice.

","My biggest problem with the class is that <Faculty Name> tries to accomodate for all students, only moving on when she is sure every single one
has grasped the concept, and there are a lot of students. She is always slowing down and repeating her elaborate explanations of basic
concepts. While I understand the benefit this has to many students, the result is that the class is way too slow paced. I often find myself
bored by her explanations, and by the time I snap back out of my daydreams, I realize that she is still explaining the same concept she had
just gone over five or even ten minutes ago. At best it is just a bore, and at worst the various different explanations she gives for the same
concept makes them seem more confusing and complex than they really are; it is easy to get lost at times, adding to the repetition. The
biggest weakness in the class are the notes, which have excessive information with very little to no relevance to what we are tested on and
hardly any information we need to know. The extra information and photos always catches me off gaurd, so I usually end up overthinking
the questions or focusing on the details instead of getting the bigger picture. It is better to rely on her lectures, but again, they are too slow
and methodical for me to get interested in the learning material. I have noticed other students who want a faster pace also tend to struggle
more than they should in this class, and I admit some of us are simpy not patient enough, including myself.

","I think that the switch to online school is hard for everybody, but I did feel that there was a huge lack of communication and lack of fully
learning the material and sometimes understanding the homework assignments. I would appreciate it if the professor made sure the
students were understanding the homework assignments instead of having them attempt everything on their own and then have a class
session at the end of the week when the assignment is already almost due in 1-3 days. If the professor specifically discussed what is
expected of us the week prior maybe there would not be so much confusion on things like SPSS. He does provide us with notes but the
notes are never as helpful as actually teaching what is expected of us. Homework 4 in particular was a nightmare in which most of us were
relearning <Faculty Name> as we were going. Nobody has time to relearn this stuff on their own with 4 other classes that they are taking. Also we
should not be expected to teach ourselves if we are paying tuition for professors and teachers to teach.

","The class did not personally help me at all. I had to learn how to do APA format at all. I did not learn or benefit from this class. Everything I
was taught I already learned in AP <Faculty Name> and Literature. I know some people did not like switching teachers because some people are not
interested in learning topics they did not sign up for like Physics or Geology. Some instructors went into detail about their topics too much
that I did not even learn ""critical thinking"". It was more of them talking about how climate was related to their majors. i understand climate
change is important but how is this supposed to help me learn about ""critical thinking"". They should prioritize teaching students about how
to actually read and understand the issues, claims, and conclusions. Some teachers even contradicted each other and had many students
focused on what an issue is and it did not help having different instructors who did not have the same teaching mindset. It just confused
everyone. They only had five days to teach us their topics and we had a test due on Saturday. It felt rushed and they did not go over
everything. I lost attendance points because I came late to class and could not turn in my homework on time. I think attendance and
homework should be separate because I will always show up to class and I was there at 8:01am and I could not turn it in. Overall, I feel
like this class should've just focused on the critical thinking aspect. It can include different majors because it was interesting; however,
relating everything to climate was too much. The only thing I enjoyed was probably Peer Mentor Fridays. I rather have that everyday and
just learn the resources on campus and how to enroll in classes and adjust to my college life. This critical thinking class had two writing
assignments that were okay. The CRAAP test was difficult because of the page limit and having to write it all in a specific structured
outline. I only liked when we walked about to ""become a titan"" and learned all the locations. I thought the seminars, office hours and videos
were a great idea because they were interesting and helped a lot.The video at the end of the semester feels too rushed. The majority of
the class will probably have to work on it outside of class hours. They should've given us the rubric, outline, and script online ahead of
time. I do not like going in to class with one hour to write a script that I was not prepared for, especially since we are studying for exams
and upcoming finals. We will not have time to prioritize this class and many students believe this class is a waste of a semester. We should
have the schedule of the whole semester so we know when the next modules, exams, writing assignments, quizzes and video projects are
coming up.

","3. His grading can be off.
When my group members and I received our group project grade, we were confused, since we received a low A when we hit all the topics.
We went to ask for advice to improve and found out, he docked us for a part that we included! His notes stated that we did not include
case studies in our PowerPoint when we added two cases- however, he did change our grade fairly, and to that, I believe was a good part
on him. This makes me wonder: if we never came to ask about our grade, we would have been unfairly graded against. Additionally, as
testing goes, it's variable. He's known to put a single multiple choice answer as 8+ points. When I confronted him about how one point can
cost us an entire letter grade, he stated that that fact was too important to forget- and in that case, I can agree with him. But I believe as an
undergraduate, you are ALLOWED to make mistakes and learn from them without too harsh of consequences. That's why we have
graduate school to further prepare us!

presentation assignments. The first quiz should be if you do it you get a100 and if you don't you get a 0 OR don't give a quiz before the
students are able to gage your expectations. I would have preferred a lecture or a reading assignment regarding each Aristotelian element
of drama before being expected to write about it for a quiz grade. It was annoying at first that people who weren't even registered for the

put more example problems on the presentation and instead of putting the solution on the presentation, she can solve it on the board so
she explain throughout each process what she is doing and why she is doing this the problem this certain way. Another thing I would like to
add is sometimes when students ask questions, she would at times calls them out for not paying attention or they should know this. Yes it
is important for students to pay attention to the class and should have an understanding of the prerequisite classes before, but calling them
out whenever they ask questions will probably discourage them to ask more questions. I recommend she refrain this habit so you don't
discourage the class from asking questions since not everyone learns at the same pace.

","-Week 1: Santa Rita flat mapping areas were unreasonably large (it was 7-8 times larger than <Faculty Name>, this was calculated!), and
expecting students to do completely individual mapping (not sharing data, even gps points...) is unreasonable, especially since no one
except a couple people have done plutonic mapping. This is much different from soft rock geological mapping, and we all should work as a
team! Obviously copying maps is not okay, but strike and dips and UTM data sharing saves a lot of time, especially when the field area is
massive. I think <Faculty Name> was hypocritical when she had her groups doing “group work” rather than individual work, as she expected...
Also, some people felt that we were just doing “slave work” for USC (Scott’s [Vali’s husband] students). We were never thanked by him nor
the students (students never introduced themselves), which was rather rude considering how much work the students have put in.
Some people complained that <Faculty Name> knew nothing of the Santa Rita Flat and was making/changing things as we went, but I give her the
benefit of the doubt and I really think <Faculty Name> was also learning with us, which was fair to understand.
Also, hesitation on leaving the field area when there was hail, lightning, and heavy rain was quite ridiculous, however <Faculty Name> did address it

students to actively listen and learn. The instructor also had great skill in allowing students to think in different ways that they might have
not thought in before, this skill was shown mostly when learning about the fallacies as well as what questions or mindset one may have
when debating. During the period of presentations, the instructor did really well in expanding on a topic or making sure a student
understands their topic by asking questions or explaining further. Some changes I would suggest for this course is for the professor to
move the course materials to either canvas or titanium. The assignment instructions on the syllabus are useful but sometimes the
instructions or requirements are changed. To avoid incidents where a student forgets what the assignment requires or when it is due, it
would be helpful to put the materials on canvas or titanium so that everything is one place for the students.

than others.
Overall, just more fairness across the board. Students don't just want a grade, they want to work to show that they are able to obtain the
grade that their comprehension reflects, and that's the issue. Knowing and understanding the information so well, attending every class
and taking notes, and to receive a C when the time amounted was not appropriately given, its sad. Just because one or two students can
get 100 with that time limit, isn't a reason to not account for the rest of the class who has shared their same concern, with nothing being
done.

","Professor <Faculty Name> was very unorganized and changed things around almost every week that stresses out students, such as assignments
and exams. It is understandable that it is difficult for professors to maneuver online classes with over a hundred students, yet I feel like
there should be fewer mistakes by now into the semester. I also understand problems with student misconduct since it is now easier for
students to cheat and it is right to go after them, however, I do not agree to punish the whole class for another student's cheating because
again, it stresses out other students who are already doing well and did nothing wrong. Yet, professor <Faculty Name> decided to shorten the
exam time to forty minutes and over fifty questions, which is not enough time; nearly everyone failed because of timing. This is not high
school where she gets to punishes everyone, this is college. She can just deal with those types of people privately and let them face their
own consequences, then move on with the whole class.

","I really think Professor <Faculty Name> should fine tune some of the ways she teaches. For one, I would assign a textbook that has everything you
need in the textbook, instead assigning one without a glossary, when knowing what is in the glossary is an important aspect of passing this
class. Secondly, I would be nice to narrow down what is specifically being gone over in the chapters, as the chapters are quite large, and it

like friends/colleagues and gives us the information in a straight forward realistic manner. He doesn't baby his class or act in an
authoritative manner that requires unrealistic expectations from students. Professor <Faculty Name> has found the perfect balance between treating
his students like real people and with kindness, but also expecting quality work and an understanding of the course contents. He's willing
to answer questions about practically anything at anytime in the day. He does not follow a strict outline of course scheduling and instead
allows the lecture to change based on what the class is interested in learning or discussing that day - as long as it is relevant - yet keeps
his expectations and grading criteria absolutely clear so there are no confusions in his class. Furthermore, even online, he goes out of the
way to ask fun questions to ensure his students are paying attention and not asleep at the computer. Professor Dosti should teach a
course to other professor's at CSUF because he is the epitome of what it means to be an excellent teacher.

","Some things to improve on would be everything overall. It is very difficult to understand and hear the lectures during class considering
some students sit further. Most importantly, the class assignments are very difficult and is almost impossible to complete right after learning
the brand new material. Usually when I learn new material, it would usually take a while for me to completely understand it. Doing the class
assignments right after learning the material is extremely difficult even though it is due at 5 on the same day. Most of us still have other
classes throughout the day and don't even get the chance to complete the assignment on time resulting in poor grades. Also, when
completing the assignments in class and asking for help, the instructor would guide us to the answer and tell us if we are correct or not.
But, then when reviewing the grade for that assignment, we would get points taken off for incorrect answer even though the instructor told
us we were correct in class. This resulted me in very poor class assignment grades which affects when overall class grade.

","I was completely disappointed in this class, Professor Than Thuy, and the entire classroom environment. Never once had I been made to
feel this ignorant and worthless in a math class than I have this year. I understand that this specific class only met once a week, meaning
that we'd have to work fast to cram teaching multiple sections into a 3 hour time period, but Ms. Than Thuy would be extremely sassy
when I'd ask ANY question regarding my understanding of how she solved a certain problem. Not only would she sass me, but during
class assignments, I would ask her questions and she'd get UPSET WITH ME for asking a question regarding something she already
explained to us, accusing us of not listening or being on our phone. I was also upset with her lack of communication during the entire
semester. She promised on the 4th week of school that she would start a Titanium and she NEVER did. Also, she made all 9 long sections
of the webassignments to be due at the end of the semester.. exactly on May 17th. I completed half of these assignments, but I still had a
lot of more work to complete online and last week (Friday the 19th), she suddenly decided to change all of the dates of the
webassignments to be due in two days (Sunday the 21st). This made the entire class stressed and caused our grade to decrease

was quite unfortunate we transitioned to an online format because I was excited to speak about my research paper. Nonetheless, she was

second half of the class material, i.e. the dissecting arguments, was a lot more difficult for everyone in the class than the first one w/ the

review the recordings.  The professor used the zoom meeting times for office hours, not instruction.  He didn't use the class time to teach.

majority of the class did bad on it and she refused to show us the mean and median of scores because of how bad they were. This is stats
and requires handwritten math work. She DID NOT give us adequate amount of time on the quizzes. I have never done so poorly before.
She also did not explain things well and she would even say to us that she knows she didn't explain some concepts right. How are we
supposed to properly understand the concept if even the teacher cannot explain it properly? Little to no guidance. She never stuck to her
word. If she said she would post the homework after class (Wednesday), she would post it on Friday and have it due Sunday. This is NOT

over the class agenda??? I dont understand why we needed to do that every single time. it was really hard to follow along with what she
was talking about, talking in circles. clarifying assignments was impossible, when one person would email her she would say one thing and
then something else to the next person. found this out when talking to other classmates who had asked the same exact question.
assignments were stressful and gave unrealistic presentation guidelines (present in 3 minutes) I felt like I didn't learn nearly as much
because we would stress out about the timing constraints more than the content. it was difficult to learn from the presentations because we
were forced to talk super fast and only briefly talk about the subject. nice lady and she always asks how we are doing but the class itself

to online class during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hoffhines's handling of the situation was abhorrent even before it was mandatory. He
never regarded the pandemic as a real problem prior to the school closure despite the clear facts that it was. When the school was starting
to transition to online instruction he was originally going to force us to still come to campus, basically all at the same time because of the
deadlines he set, to continue to do work for the class. He suggested on multiple occasions that when campus closed and classes moved
officially online ""It wouldn't be a bad thing if we all happened to be on campus in the same room at the same time."" This suggestion was
not only inappropriate but also came with a blatant disregard for the health and safety of not only his students but, for their families,
roommates, and co-workers as well. An Assistant <Faculty Name> echoed the same view when told about the comments. When asked by students
how we would continue our learning or receive help from him on our projects, he was argumentative and gave no real answers.

did not make the tests/quizzes or they were proctored or hosted on websites that he ""had no knowledge of how to use nor had even
opened since the semester started"". How can he ask us to use things like Proctorio or Connect (where we did our homework) if he did not
know how to use them? How can he be prepared to help his students if he doesn't take the time to get familiar with the sites he requires us
to use? For example, one time I told him that Proctorio was not letting me take a quiz because of connection and microphone issues and
he just replied with ""Talk to ptoctorio customer service"" and I did but the time allotted for the quiz was over (he only gave us about ten
minutes) and <Faculty Name> workers cannot reopen a quiz for students if the time the professor set for the quiz is over. All the professor needed

reflective of consideration for student learning.
Assignments could have also been graded quicker to know where students stood in the class and since certain assignments built on each
other, the revisions to one part could have given me a better sense of what to work on for the next part. I also felt there was also very little
clarity on grading, a rubric was used to grade the assignment and that would have been helpful to have prior to submitting the assignment

idea what my grade was during the semester and as a graduating senior, that is a big deal. This class was very fast paced, making it very
hard to actually learn and grasp the concepts. Additionally, the workload was outrageous. I did not get my midterm grade until the week
before finals (when it was taken 6 weeks prior). I leave this class with very little knowledge of geology or tools to help me become a better
teacher. She was not very accommodating when moving to online. When things started escalating due to Covid, she told the class ""its only
going to get harder"" as if this was our fault.  As the semester comes to a close, she expects us to complete 5 major assignments in one
week, in which she finally gave us the resources to complete in the week that it is due. Ultimately, I cannot capture all my frustration about
this professor and this class in this questionnaire.I feel very discouraged and upset about my experience in this class.

","This is more for the department, specially for the department of mathematics. If classes such as math 150B and higher ad being offered for
students such as my self that is pursuing Mechanical Engineering, there should be tutoring available at our level, because in the library
they only do up to 150 and nothing higher. I mean if you want students to succeed in this classes and not drop out, give them the tools to
do such thing. Also have more classes that are such as this one where students can go every day, personally I think I learn better this way,
because it is short classes. Plus not sure if you are aware, but now a days students work and go to school, such as my self so it is really
difficult, at least for me to try and squeeze in class in between the day, that is why I think this class was great because it was early and

","Having been exposed to art and taken art classes before, I found this course a bit confusing. I understand that it is not a ""drawing and
painting"" class, but the structure to me did not make much sense. I thought the course would have progressed in a more linear fashion, but
it seemed to kind of go all over the place. For instance, I took a Music 100 class that began with the beginning of music and ended at
music today; I thought this class being at the 100 level would have been more like that, going through the history of art and its various
movements. Also, it was not really made clear how mandatory the book was and there were no slides to follow along with, a resource that
most classes provide but seemed for the most part absent from this class. I feel this class could have been more enjoyable and made

learn or retain anything from this class. The assignments like discussions or writing responses informed me about some different cultures

instructions were vague or didn't make much sense so I could never reach him to clarify his instructions on time because he would never
answer. His grading sometimes was never clear or fair, I never really understood what requirements he wanted me to reach or what he

project management were mentioned, it seems this class was superfluous (unless I paid $600 for advice on what certificates to pursue).
The professor was unprepared for the some Excel and Project assignments, so we had to rely on other students' explanations. Mac
students were in a worse spot, with almost no guidance on anything, but I wouldn't expect the professor to be familiar with EVERY
operating system. At the end of each exam, I found myself wondering if I learned anything at all. Surely, if anything from the book I bought

","labs were not. Sometimes silly mistakes like decimal or typo will give you the automatically lose the points. I did not report all of them
except some, because I know how professor is busy answering all the emails. I am usually on the quiet side, and I am sure there are
students who constantly email, making impossible for others to ask questions. I can tell she seemed stressed because possibly by those
students that I think exist.
Aside from exams, the lab to be finished each day can be very stressful. I have other classes, other projects, sometimes due on the same
day, or the next day. This is the only class that has lab to be done on the same day. Even Geology professor extended lab due for whole
week when Covid started in the past, how generous is he.
The goal of the lecture is to make students understand and lab is just a proof that we understood, and exercise on it, just like homework.
But to enforce students to exercise it on the same day is too much, and especially, for COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENTS who are
always coding, thinking, 24/7, and behind the classes due to difficult projects. The typos or small mistakes on the lab, should be detected
and forgiven right away, if it was in the actual physical class, there wouldn't be a limit to submit lab works just like now which is very uptight
and silly... we can ask questions multiple times!.. Don't get the wrong idea that I am saying online class is bad, online class is good. It is
just not good for the lab work especially for Math class. (Lab work on Computer Science courses are excellent as online because by
nature, it is different). I say remove the lab completely, or give more flexible time to finish just like homework. Increase hours for the exam,
or reduce the amount of questions. We had over 20 multiple choices for the exam#2, and over 2 short answers. The thing is multiple
choices were confusing even if I went over all the materials and understood them all.
If I studied and understood the materials, can solve the lab works blindly, it means I reached the goal of education 100%. I can answer
professor's questions after studying because I am confident with it. But exams trick me and push me with extreme stress with short amount
of time, gives me terrible score, what was point of me reaching the goal? Is goal, even a goal?
Do we have to be an ultimate fighter who has many skills and must <Faculty Name> the opponent in real fight with limited time with no mistake?
Especially when our major is computer science, not the ultimate fighting machine in the Math? I didn't sign the contract to join the UFC of
Math. But I am to be expected to learn how to jab, kick, and just be fundamentally strong at the basic and to advance up to certain expect
where I know how to fight, maybe under the armature  level. That should be good enough.

pages per student, and give adequate feedback. The classes she was able to have face-to-face would have supported us better if the
content was broken down and organized in a different way. Candidates were left feeling frustrated and unsure how to proceed with their
TPA, and not all block leaders were able to answer questions we had. I feel it would be beneficial to have another instructor os assistant to
help students through the TPA, be more organized and clear in giving/explaining information, as well as having a class for first semester

","Professor <Faculty Name> would be better of completing independent research than teaching. He clearly has a lot of knowledge of accounting topics
but is an ineffective communicator and listener. He clearly has an expectation of what he wants but does nothing to help students get to it
or to communicate it to students. For example, we were never given a written set of directions with expectations on what the end product
should be until the very end of the class, leaving us confused the entire way. I was confused at why we spent over two months on
regression analysis when most of us hadn't even collected the data needed for regressions. In fact, when I asked one person from each
group what we were supposed to be doing, every single group (except 1 I don't have contacts with) said they were struggling on forming a
research question. I asked the professor specifically to go over how to write strong research questions and suggested he break us out into
zoom rooms and he could help each group during class. At this time, from what I heard from other groups some groups had several
different research questions, all different, whereas some groups didn't even have a question. However, even when I brought this up to the
professor he emailed me back saying that we will go over it some other time and continued to spend his lectures on regression analysis.
This is precisely what I mean when I suggest Professor <Faculty Name> should find a different field than teaching because it seems like he isn't really
interested in teaching and helping students and it's his obstinacy in focusing on what he wants to lecture when the class is clearly
uninterested because they don't find the information relevant to what they are working on. The only way groups could have known what to
do, they would have to talk to him specifically, which is rather an inefficient use of our time because the professor should have made it
clear from the beginning. When we ask questions about the meaning of our work he skirts the question, leaving us confused at why we are
doing what we are doing. All of this made our learning inefficient and even worse, meaningless.

","Well organized and since the professor was already proficient in technology and had fused some technology into our interface class, the
transition to virtual learning has actually been seamless. The use of Rezzly and Voice Thread definitely enabled a relatively robust
interactive virtual platform when the interface was eliminated. Yet, hope this pandemic experience has showcased how to integrate
technology more organically within a class, but never replace interface instruction completely. The natural flow, ability to ask questions in
the moments, share a class community of practice as well as friendships do get lost online.

","-Overall concept of the class in not that hard, if you do the homework you will do fine
-Test are base on homework and are doable as long as you put in the effort and understand the homework
-Grading for homework and exams is quick which is a good thing
-Percentage value of Exams are high and the percentage of homework is low for the amount given
-When writing notes on the board his handwriting is some times messy and illegible
-He some times rambles on certain examples and causes confusion
-For the ethics part of the class he only did one lesson and did not really go over the ethical cases that were due
-The formula sheet rule that involves only have three words per formulas I dislike, if the formula sheet is meant to help me during an exam
why can't I use it to its fullest potential I do understand agree with the rule of no examples/problems
-Do not like the rule of not being able to use a graphing calculator, I had to buy a scientific calculator to follow this rule
-He stated that he was going to put Excel questions on test but I find that stupid because were are not allowed to use the program during
the exam so we do not know if we are doing the question correctly
-When students ask question he sometimes does not know the answer and begins to ramble
-Uses Titanium but says that does not reflect our real grades which seem useless and does not allow the students to know their real
grades
<Faculty Name> time on email can take over a day
-The class seem not as useful. I am studying to become an engineer not an accountant, I would rather learn more about the ethics aspects

","It would be helpful if the instructor presented ideas visually rather than verbally. When it comes to the materials he tends to be very broad.
For example, when it came to printing he mentioned that he wanted us to use good paper but wasn't specific on what that meant. Before
going virtual there wasn't one to one critiques on project ideas it was an overall general group critique. This formate focused on only some
students' artwork but I like how virtually he is able to give individual feedback. This allows for a better understanding of how the artwork
could be improved. In regards to the interest of developing individual students, he does always say to ask questions and that he is there to
help. But when he does answer or help a student he makes it seem like it's a drag and as he says ""a waste of his time."" This then makes
students not want to ask for help. Also, it is difficult to get a hold of him when you are not in class because he doesn't reply to emails. So
the only way one can get a hold of him is during or right after class. Overall, the instructors' intentions are in the right place but I do think

student's time. She delayed posting the original material on the first week of class and then again throughout the first three weeks. She
does not provide feedback on her tests or assignments for weeks which is essentially now the whole semester. For example, we took a
test on the second week of class and advised that she would have our grade/feedback posted on Monday the 17th but has yet to do that
even after she apologized in an email on the 16th about the delay. Her tests required written answers thus not having feedback can affect
how well a student does on the next test. She has also failed to provide feedback on our posts that are an important part of our grade and
would highly impact us if we have not been doing them to her liking. As a full-time student who works full-time and travels, I rely on timely
feedback to keep me on track. Her regard for students time shows to be little to none. She will advise assignments due dates but fails to
provide the material needed to get them done prompting her to change the due date. In a regular semester class, this would not be an
issue. However being in summer we are short on time and our schedules are just as hectic and important as hers. She fails to care about

our own time in this class. This semester was more challenging than the previous one because of this pandemic; just because we are not
on campus does not mean I am home all day. This pandemic has affected my family financially, and I have to manage work and the five
classes I am taking. The only class that I have had difficulty with is this one because instead of being taught the actual material in class, I
have to do it outside plus homework. I do not usually like to complain about school because I know what I got myself into, but the two

","2. She is condescending--when students ask a question that she deems ""stupid,"" she sarcastically asks us if we are ""math majors,
because if we were true English Majors, we wouldn't ask such stupid questions.""  This causes students to not want to ask for help.  Early
on in the semester, she was teaching us IPA and I found what she was teaching us did not match her own textbook that SHE wrote. When
I asked her about it in class--stating what I read in the book verses what she taught us and which she preferred--she accused me on being
argumentative and refused to answer my question.  I stopped asking questions afterwards.  (I discovered that the IPA she was teaching us
was NOT from the book but from a simple website called EasyPronunciation.com)
    
3. She told us if we don't understand her to just seek Youtube and find British tutors.  Because, you know, learning AMERICAN grammar
from the BRITISH makes so much sense. She also mentioned if we have questions, we can just pull out our phones and google it---
regardless of the fact that cellphones were not allowed in class, nor was recording her lectures.  What she wrote on the board never made
sense and she never highlighted the key elements of what she wanted us to know.  After all this time, I STILL don't understand grammar.
She also would not pronounce things properly, nor spell things properly--key things needed in a GRAMMAR professor.

","Professor Drew made a mistake when grading one of my assignments, it took an entire week to convince her to change my grade. I had
proof that she incorrectly graded me, and she was still skeptical. She also graded my art analysis and gave me minus 5 points for citing
the video she showed in class. She specifically said that we could reference it. Her class is full of a lot of tedious small assignments, and
there aren't many big assignments. Professor Drew likes to be sarcastic when we as a class doesn't have our camera or mics on. She
makes comments like ""this is part of your participation"" or insisting that we should have both of them on. In the future, I hope Professor
Drew will realize that some students are unable to turn on their cameras for a number of reasons such as privacy and mental well being. I

",
264439,"What could the instructor do to improve the class?
","When doing excel problems, his overall teaching effectiveness would drastically improve if he labeled his columns/rows. Often, he just
types in answers without labeling what they are, which makes it easier to get lost during class. Additionally, When an excel problem
requires the same template, he should be making a copy of that excel template and creating another sheet rather than using the same one
and deleting the original material from the same template for re-use for another problem. If students have questions about a previous
problem done in class, the content is already gone.

addressed on the exam and she has refused. Now I know it is not the professor's job to provide a study guide but when there are multiple
dense historic chapters on an exam, it would be helpful for students to at least what to specifically focus on. She also gives very little time
on the exam, especially on the written portion. I think it is important to notice that the exams are in a different language and when there is a
writing portion in another language, it could take twice as long to write an essay and on top of that rushing and worrying about the time
crunch. If I knew how this class would have been before I took it, I would have not taken it, or at least with this professor. She is very
disorganized and doesn't know how to manage technology well. On top of that, our grade is made up of primarily 4 exams and projects
and if we score low on one of those, then our grades drop significantly because there is nothing else to support the grading system.
